<h3>About this Blog</h3>
<p>
As a faculty, mentor, advisor, and researcher I work with a lot of students. I find most students have similar sets of questions, struggles, and skills to master. This blog is an attempt to collate all my advice into a single archive for potential graduate students in engineering disciplines to consider.
</p>

<p>
Note that my thoughts are really only relevant to engineering and computer science disciplines, and perhaps even more narrowly focused on my particular research and don't necessarily represent my employer or the <a href="http://nimbus.unl.edu">NIMBUS lab</a>.

A site focused on my research can be found <a href="http://justinbradley.unl.edu">here</a>.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://cse.unl.edu">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="http://unl.edu">University of Nebraska - Lincoln</a>. I am also a co-director of the <a href="http://nimbus.unl.edu">NIMBUS lab</a> where my research focuses on the intersection of control and computer science with applications in aerospace vehicles.</p>

<p>
My background is fairly broad and spans several disciplines. I have a BS in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://byu.edu">BYU</a>, a MS in Electrical Engineering also from BYU where I was in the <a href="https://magicc.byu.edu/">MAGICC lab</a>. I then worked for a time as a software engineer at <a href="http://llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> on the integrated computer control system for the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/">National Ignition Facility</a>. I then matriculated at the <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">University of Michigan Aerospace Engineering Department</a> where I earned MS and PhD degrees in Aerospace Engineering under the advisement of Dr. Ella M. Atkins. I have worked with UAS for roughly a decade, and can fly quadcopters, fixed wing, and helicopter model aircraft.</p>
