title: About Me
---

<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://cse.unl.edu">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="http://unl.edu">University of Nebraska - Lincoln</a>. I am also a co-director of the <a href="http://nimbus.unl.edu">NIMBUS lab</a> where my research focuses on the intersection of control and computer science with applications in aerospace vehicles.</p>

<p>
My background is fairly broad and spans several disciplines. I have a BS in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://byu.edu">BYU</a>, a MS in Electrical Engineering also from BYU where I was in the <a href="https://magicc.byu.edu/">MAGICC lab</a>. I then worked for a time as a software engineer at <a href="http://llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> on the integrated computer control system for the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/">National Ignition Facility</a>. I then matriculated at the <a href="https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">University of Michigan Aerospace Engineering Department</a> where I earned MS and PhD degrees in Aerospace Engineering under the advisement of Dr. Ella M. Atkins. I have worked with UAS for roughly a decade, and can fly quadcopters, fixed wing, and helicopter model aircraft.</p>

<p>
This blog is a way for me to write things that I have discussed with students and colleagues in hopes of helping others. A more professional site can be found <a href="http://justinbradley.unl.edu">here</a>.
