Getting a PhD requires **A LOT** of work and years of dedication to a very narrow topic. As a professor, it is also a **MASSIVE** investment. In the engineering disciplines it is common for PhD students to be fully funded either through a grant obtained by their advisor, or through a TA position. In the former case the investment on the part of the professor is both pecuniary and temporal. It is common for a new student to produce little the first year. So as a professor we won't see a return on investment for up to a year or longer. The bottom line is that a PhD is a risky pursuit for everyone involved.
