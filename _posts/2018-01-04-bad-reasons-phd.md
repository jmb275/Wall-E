Getting a PhD requires **A LOT** of work and years of dedication on the part of both the student and advisor. You need to be sure your reasons are good enough to keep you motivated for the duration.

For a list of bad reasons see [this post]({% post_url 2018-01-04-good-reasons-phd %}).

So without further ado, the list of top bad reasons to get a PhD (in no particular order):

### Someone didn't think you could

Because someone said they didn't think you could do it. This isn't a very good reason to do anything. 

I know from personal experience this can lead to a very trying PhD experience.

### You want to explore your own ideas

You have great ideas and want to explore them. Having someone fund your great ideas is a reward you get after completing a PhD and finding a funding source.

Your advisor likely gets grants to accomplish his/her research objectives. Depending on your advisor you may get to explore some of your own ideas in varying amounts depending on your research prowess. For the most part you'll be contributing to the research program of your advisor.

### You want to build things

You like to build things (e.g. robots, websites, networks) and see them work. This is what engineers do and there are plenty of industry jobs to do that. A PhD program is not the time or place.

Your PhD will take too long and you will get frustrated and frustrate your advisor.

### You want to acquire more knowledge

You like learning things and want to learn more. There are **SO SO MANY** places and ways to learn things online now. Please utilize online courses or certificate training to acquire new skills rather than pursue a PhD.

Again, your PhD will take too long and you will get frustrated and frustrate your advisor.

### You want to be called "Dr."

You want the title, prestige, praise associated with getting a PhD. 

Bluntly, this is **NOT** worth it.

### Money

You want to earn more money. Bang for buck, the sweetspot is with a MS degree in an engineering or computer science discipline. The PhD takes twice as long as a MS and wages don't increase commensurate with the effort.

Better to stop with the MS, get a solid job and get promoted.

### Conclusions

If you are considering a PhD, or are in a PhD program and these (or a subset) are your reasons, please:
* be honest with your advisor so she/he can make decisions in the best interest of their research program
* see how they could lead to [10 easy ways to fail a PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/ways-to-fail-a-phd/)
