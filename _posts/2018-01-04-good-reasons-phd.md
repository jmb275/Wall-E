Getting a PhD requires **A LOT** of work and years of dedication on the part of both the student and advisor. You need to be sure your reasons are good enough to keep you motivated for the duration.

For a list of bad reasons see [this post]({% post_url 2018-01-04-bad-reasons-phd %}).

So without further ado, the list of top reasons to get a PhD (in order):

### You love research

You love research and eventually want someone to fund you to conduct your own research. Or, as a corollary, you like [pushing the boundaries of human knowledge](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) and want to contribute to it.

This is the best reason, and in my opinion, the only good reason to get a PhD.

### You want to be a professor

You want to be a professor.

Examine what about being a professor is attractive to you. If it's research...great! If you love teaching there **may** be better ways to get into a teaching profession that don't require a PhD.

### In Conclusion

Honestly, there aren't many great reasons, in my mind, to get a PhD beyond these. 

The economic payoff isn't worth it (PhDs don't earn much more than MS), and the opportunity cost is large.

Faculty jobs are scarce and extremely competitive so you have to be near the top of your game to get one.

The best reason to get a PhD is that you want someone to eventually fund you to conduct your own research upon getting the PhD. Perhaps you plan to start a small technology company, or work in the research division of a company, or be a consultant.

But if you don't love research you should seriously think twice about getting a PhD.
